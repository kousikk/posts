So.. After quite a bit of skull duggery, I finally have my blog right here. It does feel quite awesome to write a blog. Learnt a lot of new things while trying to build this blog. Anyone who has a license to program shall be given the license to read my blog.

Blog created during a time when perfection is a sin.
