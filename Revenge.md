revenge, sweet, awesomeness
-->

Trust me, no matter what anyone says revenge is sweet. Its wrong, but the inner feeling of deliciousness that you get is just, yummy. 

The backdrop:
-------------
I must have been in my 5th grade. It was my uncle's house warming ceremony. My uncle is quite well off and his house was furnished with the most exquisite gadgets you could think of. Computers(back in the year 2004), iPods, mobile phones, stylish Televisions, mammonth Refrigerators... you name it, and he would have it. I was(and still am) a gadget freak and a particular item caught my interest was a remote operated burner. It caught my wildest imaginations and I didn't pause to think that if I operated it without my uncles's permission it would piss him off. So I just took it and fiddled with it, when my cousin came in and snatched the remote from my hands. He just murmured something like, "Oh how dare you touch it. You don't even know the basic blah.. blah.. blah". But that was enough. It was such a shame to me. He could've handled it better. He could've been kind. He need not have <b>snatched</b> the remote from my hands. But... He did :-)

The Surprise:
-------------
And recently I got a job at the very same company he has been working for >3 years, having a role that is comparitively higher paid that his. I never expected it to happen, I really wanted to get a job at some other company.<br>
To top it all, I had to go to the company for some xyz work yesterday, and guess who I saw, HIM. Brownie points if you can guess what I saw. HE WAS SMOKING. Being an orthodox and stuff, smoking has zero tolerance in my family. I am quite sure the implications will be a bit severe if I tell my dad mom about what I saw. I wanted to.. I mean here is my opportunity to take REVENGE for... For what? Snatching a remote out my hand? Huh? Seriously? Nah, my conscience did not agree with it. Its too much for what he did. So I am writing a blog post out of it. Its a quiet form of revenge.
